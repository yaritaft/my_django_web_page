<p>My name is Yari Ivan Taft and I am geek. I have always loved technology, when I was ten I realized
    that computers are awesome, that being able to tell a machine what to do is like having a super
    power. At that age I just wanted to learn more a more. First of all, I started playing some
    PC games and when I was eleven we hired an ISP to have unlimited internet without having to use
    the telephone line. 
 </p><br>
 <p>When I was eleven, a friend of my father came to our house, he was living in USA and he was working
     and he still does for Microsoft in Seatle. By that time I was really surprised but that chance of
     moving from one country to the other. And when he told that he was systems engineer I was really
     surprised because at that time could realize that technology could be a good way to develop my
     professional career. That idea never left my head. 
 </p><br>
 <p>Having internet literally changed my life, at first I continue playing online games until fourthteen.
    Then I started making some posts in a web forum very well known in Argentina, it is called "Taringa"
    That was my first approach to HTML but language used there was called BBcodes. I could create 
    on of the best posts of the website, weekly around 10 posts out of thousands were selected to 
    the best posts of the week. To make good posts I had to learn a little bit of desing, photoshop,
    image compression, and some other things such as editing a video with adobe premiere. And also,
    I learnt how to edit an audio, audio, video and image formats, etc.
     </p><br>

    When I was sixteen I was really interested in ethical hacking, so I started learning in a community
    that is called "indetectables", It was really interesting and in that place I could learn ton of things
    related to security. In fact, I think that most of the security precautions that I take now a days are
    things that I learnt in that community. There I learnt what was a trojan and how to build one, how to forward
    ports, which are the most used ports and which services use them, what is a public IP address and what a 
    private IP address, how to setup a router, what is MAC filtering, which is the importance of using HTTPS instead of
    HTTP, the difference between SFTP and FTP, how antivirus works and what heuristics are, what is the HOSTS file in 
    Windows, how to set a process to be executed when windows starts, and so many things more.
</p><br>
<p>
    Then, when I was seventeen and I was very close to start my studies as System engineer I started learning
    scripting with batch language. I found it really interesting and easy. By that time, I was using the goto commando
    almost to do everything. Then when I started learning Pascal I was told that the goto command should not be used, And
    that was a challenge for me because I was really used to using it. I learnt the basics with Pascal.
</p><br>
<p>
    After that I could finally, start my studies in the UTN and there I continue learning how to code and a lot of
    things more, such as maths, physics, chemestry, management. In my first year I learnt how to code in C++ without
    using objects. We saw up to dynamic memory data structures.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    In my second year, I learnt C with a very difficult project, we had to replicate hadoop, with it's filesystem, 
    planner, jobs, nodes, redundancy, etc. Using pipes, sockets, serialization, and a lot of things more.
    I also learnt a lot of semantic and syntax with C too, we saw what is a parser, a compilter, logical languages,
    logical rules, graphs, trees, turing machine, etc. We had to build our own compiler.
    I also learnt the same year, about objects, functional and logic paradigms. We learnt logic paradigm
    with prolog, functional with Haskell and Objects with smalltalk. We were also told how to use git.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    In my third year, we saw desing patterns and how to use them an represent them with UML. We also saw 
    a lot of things related to databases, hash algorithms, binary trees, and some disks theory. And of course,
    we were told how to build a database, how to use SQL and all the theory around it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Then the rest of my career was very interesting but we did not see anything else related to development itself.
    Instead we learnt about architectures, networks, deployments, economics and a lot of project management. The only
    thing we saw related to development was some simulation algorithms that were really hard.
    At the same time, when I was finishing my studies I started working as functional analyst.
    That role taught me how to engage customers, how to find out which are the customers needs And
    how to desing a solution.
    Then I started working as a data engineer and in that role I learnt how to develop, how to
    improve queries, how to deploy and app, and I could improve my english as well working for a
    international company.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    After university my professional career as a developer began, and I started diving into python,
    by taking a lot of courses, reading the documentation, watching and assisting pyconfs and reading
    books (dive into python is my favourite). Then I started making my first web page in order to learn 
    the whole process that involves. I.E how to integrate a web app with a DB using an ORM, deploy 
    things in a Cloud service and using a domain service.
    Finally, I changed my job, I was working as a data engineer and nowadays I am working as software
    developer in a great software factory. I made that change because I felt that I was not learning
    as much as I wanted.
